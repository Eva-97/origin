Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Camelot. There lived a young king named Arthur on whose shoulder lies the destiny and redemption 
of Camelot. He had an evil uncle called Sax who torments the Kingdom of Camelot with sorcery and his army of the dead. The young 
king sought to put an end to his uncle's evil deeds and also avenge his father who was killed by one of Sax's warlord, Mars.
On his quest to bring peace to his kingdom, the young king set out to the Land of the Dwarfs which is far North to meet a very 
powerful sorceress called Morgana. There Arthur learnt his fate was to bring an end to Sax and the evils he brought upon his kingdom.   
Arthur acepted his fate and set out for this daunting task. Will he defeat Sax and his evil warlords or will he fall into the hands 
of this heartless uncle?
